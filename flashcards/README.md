# Flashcards
I have develop a basic Angular app for a flashcard game. I have also introduced some of the built-in attributes and structural directives in the Angular framework and created a basic template-driven form so that I can add/edit the flashcards. I you will be introduced to observables and learn how to use the async pipe to get observable data on the page. I have also create a basic FlashService to perform all the operations related to adding, editing, and deleting flashcards.
